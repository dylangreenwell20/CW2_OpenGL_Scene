# CW2_OpenGL_Scene
COMP3016 C++ OpenGL Scene

This scene contains 15 spinning cubes with a texture loaded on to each one. There is also a single, stationary cube in the middle of the scene with the same texture loaded on to it so that the texture/signature can be read easily.

You can move around the scene using WASD on the keyboard and by moving the mouse around to look around the scene.

The signature that I put into the scene to show it as my own work is my student number (10752010) on each cube.

I created the texture on the cube myself and have not used any third-party assets in the scene.
